Description of the project:

Create a tribute page similar to the one at: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW

Fulfill the following user stories:

1. I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
2. I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic. (make sure to use target=_blank on the link so it will work in CodePen.io)

I'm not going to worry about responsive design for this one, just going to make a page with several rows of images, text, etc... that stacks the same on all screen sizes.

Probably won't need much custom CSS, the goal of the project is just to get a simple website up that uses Bootstrap and a few easy HTML techniques.
